ITECH GH - HOPS Example
=======================================

This repo was created for an ITECH seminar "Computational Design".

To run the code, first follow the steps:

1 - create a virtual environment in your desired location

2 - install python and the requirements libraries with "pip install -r   requirements.txt" inside your virtual environment

3 - activate your environment and run the server with "python app.py"

4 - open the Hops_FitCrv.gh and test the hops endpoints

the hops endpoints in this example are:

/sum
/plotFit
/fitCurve
/savePoints
/predictPoint

5 - make a new change to Lior's readme file
